      <h2>Editor, Actors, Malandi</h2>
      <p>
       I'm a storyteller at heart    part editor, part actor, and 100% personality.
With a passion for seamless transitions and emotionally driven scenes, I thrive both behind the screen and in front of the camera. My editing brings rhythm and polish to raw footage, while my acting breathes life into characters and moments.Whether itâ€™s adding charm to a performance or extra flair to a project, I believe that boldness and authenticity make everything more memorable.
